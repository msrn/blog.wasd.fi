title: 'The Bridge and Gene Sprague'
---

Recenetly watched the somewhat infamous Bridge documentary from 2006, which centers around the Golden Gate suicide jumpers. Critically the documentary was averagely rated, but personally it is one of those movies that will just get stuck inside your for long while.
Throughout the documentary Gene Sprague's faith is treated as the red line, whos destiny is also the end of the documentary. At some points the teasing of Gene's upcoming demise seems somewhat perverted by the film makers, but the ending still shocks you.

Due to this character build up he is the most proniminent character in the film, and because of this I decided to look more about him.

Curiosuly you can still find his old Livejournal blog and some old videogame modding related articles.
