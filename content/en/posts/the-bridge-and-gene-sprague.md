title: 'The Bridge and Gene Sprague'
---

Recently watched the somewhat infamous Bridge documentary from 2006, which centers around the Golden Gate suicide jumpers. Critically the documentary was averagely rated, but personally it is one of those movies that will just get stuck inside your head for a while.
Throughout the documentary Gene Sprague's faith is treated as the red line, whos destiny is also the end of the documentary. At some points the teasing of Gene's upcoming demise seems somewhat perverted by the film makers, but the ending still shocks you.

Due to this character build up he is the most proniminent character in the film, and because of this I decided to look more about him.

Curiously you can still find his old Livejournal blog\[1\] and some old videogame modding related articles and websites \[3\]\[4\]\[4\]. On online he went by the name of »F®èékßøÿG« or just FreekBoyG

From the blogs and some comments\[2\] it is revealed that Gene was Senior Customer Service representative at CapCom and was laidoff with zero notice after a five year of employment. According to Mobygames he was also tester for few Capcom games such as Ghost N Goblins and  1942 for GBC \[6\]. Gene was also an avid skinner and modder for Unreal Tournament.

THe blog entry Gene was in 2004-01-10, and Gene took his life on 2004-05-11\[7\]. Somewhat creepily the last blog entry is titled as "**SMACK**, and according the posts he really was in rough spot during the time. Getting laid off in christmas is just extreme cruelty. I don't want to analyze these posts too much, as everyone can read them, but in the end I hope he found his peace.

I just wanted to gather this post about the findings of Gene that the public web still has. Seemingly he had a personal website hosted at `http://216.103.113.4/UT/FreekBoyG/freeks/freekstoybox.htm`, but I don't think it is archived anywhere.
