In recent months, Traficom caused a small "uproar" when the Ministry of Transport and Communications proposed that the price of fi domains would increase from €9 to €12, and that domain name registrars would be charged an annual fee of €400 [^1](https://www.lausuntopalvelu.fi/FI/Proposal/Participation?proposalId=bb3cd297-6c3b-456e-b647-e434208148ef) .

The statements given by individuals and companies were generally against it, but some statements were in favor of the proposals. Of these, what caught my eye the most was that the statements in favor were statements from larger web hosting and domain brokerage companies. From the purpose of these statements, it can be assumed that they want to smoke smaller and private actors out of the playing field, that "professional" actors can guarantee a more reliable and secure service. As is evident from this statement by Shellit.org, for example.

I should renew my domain at the beginning of the year, and while researching

When I was looking for the cheapest way to renew a domain, I noticed that a very typical strategy for these big companies is to offer a cheap initial domain registration and charge more than triple the amount for renewal. For example, in the case of the aforementioned Shellit.org, the normal price for registration is €21.50/year, but I couldn't find the renewal price on their website.

Based on the large number of responses, the Ministry of Transport and Communications removed the domain name registrar change from the regulation, and plans to reassess the matter. [^3](https://valtioneuvosto.fi/paatokset/paatos?decisionId=5370)

> The new annual domain name registrar fee (400 euros) proposed in the draft regulation will be completely removed from Section 2 of the regulation due to the reassessment of the legal basis.
